##As a data analyst, I want to be able to generate a report showing the top 10 most populated cities in a specific continent so that I can compare urbanization levels across regions.
#Acceptance Criteria:
The system should allow selecting a continent from a dropdown menu.
The system should allow specifying the number of cities to be displayed (e.g., top 10).
The report should display the city name, country, and population for each selected city.
