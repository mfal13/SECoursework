## User Stories

## 1. As a Data Analyst, I want to be able to filter population data by country, region, city, and other geographic levels so I can easily access relevant information for my analysis.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should provide a user interface for selecting different geographic levels (e.g., drop-down menus, interactive maps).
- Users should be able to combine multiple filters to narrow down the results (e.g., filter by country and then by city within that country).
- Filters should be applied dynamically, updating the displayed data in real-time.


## 2. As a researcher, I want to be able to generate a report showing the top 10 most populated cities in a specific continent so that I can compare urbanization levels across regions.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should allow selecting a continent from a dropdown menu.
- The system should allow specifying the number of cities to be displayed (e.g., top 10).
- The report should display the city name, country, and population for each selected city.

## 3. As an IT Security Specialist, I want to configure user roles and permissions so I can restrict access to sensitive data based on user needs and responsibilities.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should allow defining different user roles with varying levels of access to data and functionalities.
- Administrators should be able to assign specific roles to individual users or user groups.
- Access control rules should be enforced to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.

## 4. As a Policymaker, I want to see a visual representation of key population data trends (e.g., population growth, urbanization rates) so I can quickly understand the information and make informed decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should integrate visualization libraries to generate charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs).
- Users should be able to choose which data points to visualize and customize the visualization format.
- Visualizations should be clear, concise, and easy to interpret for users with limited technical expertise.
